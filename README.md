### Ride-My-Way

Ride-my App is a carpooling application that provides drivers with the ability to create ride offers
and passengers to join available ride offers.

As a driver, i am able to add a ride offer, view all the requesta to that drive offer and accept or 
reject requests to an offer.

As a passenger, i am able to view al available ride offers, view the details and request for a ride.
Users of this system should be able to view their profiles, see the number and details of the rides they've taken 
and as well the details of those they gave.
